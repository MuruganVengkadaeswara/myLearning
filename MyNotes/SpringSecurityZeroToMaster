Spring Security : 
=================
	
	
-> Security
-> Passwords
-> Users and roles
-> multiple logins
-> fine grained security
-> CSRF and CORS
-> JWT and OAUTH2
-> Preventing attacks

Agenda:
======

1 Spring security core

2 Authentication and
  Authorisation
 
3 Password Management

4 Global method security
 
5 OAUTH2 , CSRF , CORs , JWT


Introduction to security
========================

What is security?

-> to protect the data and business logic in your application

-> security is non functional requirement
	
	* e.g performance , scalablilty

-> Security from DEV phase

-> Diff types of security
	Https ,ssl, authentication, authorisation


-> Avoiding common attacks
	-> CSRF, broken authentication



Spring security is a dedicated framework



Starting basic spring security project:

-> dependency : 

		* Spring starter security
		* Spring starter web





By default all the APIs are protected with spring security

	-> 
	
	
* in application.properties
	we can define custom user name and password
	
	user.name = 
	user.password = 
	
* if we refresh after authentication , we dont need to authenticate again

* browser is storing token / session?

* from postman we can give username and password in authorisation tab
	
	-> username , password

* a Cookie called JSESSIONID is stored in headers in browser and postman

* for unauthorised authorisation also the cookie will get stored so everytime user will receive unauthorsied response

* this JSESSION cookie is maintained by spring security

* we can optimise this by use of JWT and OAUTH




Spring secutiy internal flow
============================
and architecture:
================



user (credentials)
-> 
authentication filter 
(Class)
->
Authentication (Object) (Interface)
->
Authentication manager (Interface)
-> 
Authentication Provider (Interface)
-> 
UserDetailsService , Password encoder (Interfaces)
-> 
Authentication manager 
->(Interface)
Authentication filter 
-> 
SecutiryContext 
(Interface)
-> 
User

Security context is the place where we store the data of user once he is authenticated

(valid / invalid) 


if same security info is passed again -> we will get from context ?





Authentication provider is where we define how the user should be authenticated

Security context is the interface where we store the authenticated user details


* By default all the endpoints will be authorised


* For basic security config
	
	-> create a class and extend the  
	websecurityconfigurerAdapter
	
	-> annotate with @configuration
	

	-> the default configure method will say to authenticate anyrequest()
	
	
	-> Configure() will acced HttpSecurity Object


* How to provide a service without the authorisation?

	
	in configure method
	
	-> authorizeRequests()
		.antMatchers(urlPattern)
		.authenticated()
		
		
	-> use .authenticated() to authenticate .permitAll() if not required
	
	
* How to deny all the request?

	-> anyRequest().denyAll()

-> what does formLogin() and httpBasic() mean?

* How to permit all request?

	-> anyRequest().permitAll()




Defining and managing users:
============================


	
-> UserDetailsService & PasswordEncoder


-> Creating multiple users 
   with roles and authorities
   
   
   
** 

override another method in securityConfiguration

configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)

	auth.inMemoryAuthentication.withUser("").password.authorities("").and()....continueForMoreUsers


finally should pass 

	.passwordEncoder(encoder)


-> 


spring security considers inmem users as priority than in application.properties




-> Also can use 
	
	InMemoryUserDetailsManager()
	
	we can build userDetails
	
	pass the inMemoryUserDetailsManager to auth.userDetailsService()
	
	create a bean of passwordEncoder type 
	
	framework will take the bean automatically
	
	
	
-> Framework always expects passwordEncoder 


How user details , userdetails service and manager are linked?
========================================

* InMemoryUserDetailsManager
* JdbcUserDetailsManager
* LdapUserDetailsManager
			|
			|
			V
   UserDetailsManager (Inteface)
			|	(extends)
			V
   UserDetailsService (Interface)
			|	(extends)
			V
	  UserDetails     (Interface)

Abstract methods in UserDetails Interface:

	* getPassword()
	* getUserName()
	* getAuthorities()
	* isAccountNotExpired()
	* isAccountNonLocked()
	* isCredentialsNonExpired()
	* isEnabled()

	
Abstract methods in UserDetailsService Interface:

	* loadUserByUserName(String userName)

	return userDetails



Abstract methods in UserDetailsManager Interface:

	* createUser(UserDetails user)
	* updateUser(UserDetails user)
	* deleteUser(String userName)
	* changePassword(String op , String np)
	* userExists





UserDetailsManager handles everything related to user


-> InMemoryUserDetailsManager , JdbcUserDetailsManager , LdapUserDetailsManager (ldapServer)
all are implemented in spring framework


-> User implements UserDetails and CredentialsContainer

-> UserBuilder is inner class in User
   can build the user 	

-> UserDetailsService

	always query using userName
	(to avoid the password expose in DB logs)

-> Compares with passwordEncoder


-> there is AuthenticationProvider which helps 

-> To crud user details -> implement userDetailsManager interface

 InMemoryUserDetailsManager , JdbcUserDetailsManager , LdapUserDetailsManager (ldapServer)


 
UserDetailsPasswordService :
===========================




JdbcUserDetailsManager:
======================

* loadUserByUserName()



Creating MySql DB in AWS:
=========================

 -> check free tier
 -> db instance identifier
 -> give master user name and password
 -> create database

-> Modify the database (set a new rule for public access)
-> (under additional connectivity configuration)

-> may need spring security ldap dependency


-> return the JdbcUserDetailsManager(datasource) 

Customising JdbcUserDetailsManager
==================================
