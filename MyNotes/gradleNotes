Gradle MasterCourse:
====================
DSL -> Domain Specific Language

Gradle depends on Groovy

Groovy is DSL

The build script uses proper programming languge



Groovy:
========

def listName = ["item1" , "item2"]

listName.each{
    println it
}

-> Semi colons are optional in groovy

-> java equivalent will be declaring and initialising the list and using for each to print

class in groovy:
================

class Person{
    String name
    String age

    Person(name,age){
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }

    def increaseAge(Integer years){
        this.age += years
    }
}


=> Groovy is backwards compatible with JAVA


-> build scripts are present in build.gradle
-> build.gradle is present in root folder of project


-> Eclipse has buildship plugin 


Using Gradle:
=============

-> create a build.gradle in the project 

-> Right click on the project -> configure -> add gradle nature

-> To run the gradle script inside eclipse 
we need to create a run configurations

->
