Spring learning
----------------

inversion of control : 
----------------------
    IOC is the concept of 
    outsourcing the construction and 
    managing the objects

    Application -> Object factory
    -> create objects
    based on configuration

spring container works as object factory

primary functions of spring container:

    -> create and manage objects (IOC)
    -> inject object dependency (dep injection)


    3 types of configs :
     
        XML
        Java annotations
        java source code

Dependency injection :
----------------------

Dependecy inversion principle

    client delegates to another object the responsibiliy of providing its dependency

    
    injection types: 

        -> constructor injection

        use for required dependency



        -> setter injection

Autowiring:
