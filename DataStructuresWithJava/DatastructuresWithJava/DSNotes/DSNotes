Data Structures :
===================

		A data structure is a way of organizing data in a specific way / fashion so that later on 
		it can be accessed / queried / updated quickly or easily.
		
Abstract data type (ADT):
=========================

		An abstract data type (ADT) is simply an abstraction of a data structure. 
		It provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. 
		The interface doesnâ€™t provide any specific details about how something
		should be implemented or in what programming language. 
		
		E.g : 
		
		List  --> ArrayList
		Queue --> priorityQueue
		Map	  --> HashMap
		Tree  --> RBtree

		
Array :
